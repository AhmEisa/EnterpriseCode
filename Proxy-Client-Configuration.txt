* Consuming WCF Services

Complex process to establish communication with a hosted service : Lots of low-level stuff (unamanged code)
        Pipe establishment
		Handshaking
		Security exchange
		Message transmision

This is where SOAP tooling comes in as 
      Client wants to know what is available and the data shape

The Proxy
    WCF provides the ClientBase<T> class where T : is the service Contract
	Proxy implments the the service contract Interface
	Proxy use Channel property from CleintBase<T> 
	Proxy require endpoint information : can be from code or configuration
    Contracts assembly can be shared by client side dependent on the application architecture
