* Contracts are part of WCF Explicitness

* Data Contracts define the shape of the data:
    Request data goes TO the service
	Response data returns FROM the Service

* Service Contract define the API
         List of operations that a client can call

* Use DataContractSerializer instead of XmlSerializer because it is Opt-in serializer.

* Services are the implementation of the service contract for the server side of the wire.
          It is the first line of contact and manages all down level calls.

* Golden rule of testability
      Do not instantiate dependencies.
	  use constructor overloading to make the class available for testing
	  and provide concrete implementation on testing
